# Program flows
The player is presented with three pictures and clicks on one.<br>
The computer randomly generates one of the three options, Rock, paper, or scissors.<br>
The winner or tie is calculated and shown on screen.  Clicking on rock, paper, and scissor is temporarily disabled.<br>
The player clicks on the ‘next round’ button, which resets the screen and allows for a new round to be played.
